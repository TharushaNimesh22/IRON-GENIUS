# IRON-GENIUS - Automated Switch for Clothing Iron (EN1190 – Engineering Design Project)

Designed a smart auto-off multiplug socket that improves household safety by automatically disconnecting power to a clothing iron after periods of inactivity. The system uses a wired vibration-based motion sensor and an embedded microcontroller to detect usage, trigger visual alerts, and safely switch AC power using an opto-isolated TRIAC circuit. A custom two-layer PCB was designed with proper AC–DC isolation, high-current trace sizing, and thermal considerations to ensure reliability and safety.
